# Filtering-Signals
In this project, I used a MATLAB program to first design a filter that would serve to clean a noisy ECG signal. In this part, I used the Filter Designer Toolbox for the job. Then for the second half of the project, I modeled the process of amplitude modulation through a modulation/demodulation system.
This project was done for Dr. Khoubroy's Signals and Systems class at the Unviersity of Texas at Dallas
